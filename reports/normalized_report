1. Unnormalized Data (UNF)

Initially, suppose all information (books, members, authors, staff, etc.) was stored in a single large table — with repeating groups like multiple books per member, multiple authors per book, etc.

Example of unnormalized data:

MemberID	MemberName	Email	BookTitle	AuthorName	StaffName	...
M01	John Doe	john@mail.com
	Harry Potter	J.K. Rowling	Sarah	...
M01	John Doe	john@mail.com
	Fantastic Beasts	J.K. Rowling	Sarah	...

Issues:

Repeated member data

Redundancy and inconsistency risk

Difficult updates and deletions

2. First Normal Form (1NF)

Rule: Eliminate repeating groups — each cell holds only one value.

✅ All entities now have atomic attributes (no multi-valued or repeating fields).

Example:

Member table contains single values per field (no multiple books in one column).

Books table stores one book per row.

Reports table links many-to-many relationships properly.

All tables satisfy 1NF.

3. Second Normal Form (2NF)

Rule: No partial dependency — every non-key attribute must depend on the whole primary key.

For tables with single-attribute primary keys (e.g., AUTHOR, BOOKS, STAFF, Member), all non-key attributes depend on the PK.

For Reports(BOOK_ID, MEMBERS_ID), both fields form the composite PK, and no other attributes exist → 2NF satisfied.

✅ No partial dependencies exist.

All tables satisfy 2NF.

4. Third Normal Form (3NF)

Rule: No transitive dependency — non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.

Let’s check each:

Table	Potential Dependency	Resolved?	Reason
Authentication_System	password → login_ID only	✅	Independent attributes
STAFF	Email, Name depend on STAFF_ID	✅	No transitive dependency
AUTHOR	Name, Email depend on AUTHOR_ID	✅	All attributes directly depend on PK
BOOKS	AUTHOR_ID is FK (not transitively dependent)	✅	Normalized correctly
Member	BOOK_ID and STAFF_ID are FKs	✅	No non-key to non-key dependency
Reports	Only composite keys	✅	Fully normalized

✅ All tables are in 3NF.
